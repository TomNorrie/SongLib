
Bugs:
	* Only the cancel button for the delete button group consumes VK_Esc


Missing Features:
	* Make window resizeable
	* Need error prompts
	

General To-Do:
	*Need to completely go over the loading/saving mechanism--understand how these buffers work!
	*Should implement different button menus as different scenes
		*Maybe make the menu bars different fxml files and then place them within a borderpane
		 where the current anchorpane is.
